The slides provides general informations, but more informations are also in the code.

The tutorial is interactive! You have to implement the exercises to progress.

You have to implement all the steps marked in source as '##'. 

Steps are numbered: `1a`, `1b`, `2a`, `2b`, `2c` and so on.

You can search for `##` in the folder `package` to find all the exercises:

Implement exercises in order (`1a`, `1b`, `1c`) then run the tests to ensure you did correctly.

Note that exercises are grouped: to pass `text_X` you need to implement all the `Xa`, `Xb`, ... `Xn`.
